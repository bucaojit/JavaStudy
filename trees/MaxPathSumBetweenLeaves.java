	// For this solution, will not consider those and keep it simple.

	// Have to save current state as we visit each node
	// For each node we will get the max of the left tree and the right tree
	// Add that to the current node, if it is larger than the 'largest'
	// sum, then we replace that sum and check the next node.

	// For improvements we can apply dynamic programming techniques by
	// saving values as well in the nodes.  Start at the leaf nodes and calculate 
	// their values first before the root nodes.
	
	// First step is to solve it in a simple way
