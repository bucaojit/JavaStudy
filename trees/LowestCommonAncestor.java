	PROBLEM  Given the value of two nodes in a binary search tree, find the lowest
	(nearest) common ancestor. You may assume that both values already exist in
	the tree.
	For example, using the tree shown in Figure 5-7, assume 4 and 14 are the two
	given nodes. The lowest common ancestor would be 8 because itâ€™s an ancestor to
	both 4 and 14, and there is no node lower on the tree that is an ancestor to both 4
	and 14.
